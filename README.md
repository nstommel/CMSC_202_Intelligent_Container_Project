# CMSC_202_Intelligent_Dynamic_Storage_WIth_Iterators_Class
This project implements a dynamically allocated and intelligent storage container class for any defined type that contains an array of data that resizes itself based on a logarithmic function in relation to the number of elements added or deleted. Constant and random iterators as well as numerous overloaded operators are implemented for this "sorted" class. Exceptions are also fully implemented to prevent illegal access, deletion, or write operations in memory.
sorted_driver.cpp is a test program for checking functionality of the class and includes a list of songs illustrating a templated string type container.
mytest.cpp is a more extensive test program for the sorted<T> container class and its associated const_iterator and rand_iterator.
