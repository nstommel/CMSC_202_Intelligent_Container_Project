# CMSC_202_Intelligent_Dynamic_Storage_WIth_Iterators_Class
This project implements a dynamically allocated and intelligent storage class for any type of an array of data that resizes itself based on the number of elements added or deleted. Constant and random iterators as well as overloaded operators are implemented for this "sorted" class. Exceptions are also fully implemented to prevent illegal access, deletion, or write operations in memory.
